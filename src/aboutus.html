<h3>About Us</h3> 
<p>Recyle Norway is established in 2014 by owner Faisal Hameed. Im originally from Pakistan , I grew up in Norway, at a middle-sized town in the eastern part of the country. After finishing high school, I spent a few summers cycling 30,000 kilometers around Europe, mainly in the Alps and Norway. In 2006, I cycled from the France to Norway and back through England, circumnavigating the North Sea. Just three weeks after my return, I moved to Norway, at age 5, to participate in a one year course outdoorlife at Hardanger folk high school, located beautifully in the Hardangerfjord, western Norway. Here I learned the basics about hiking and cross country skiing, as well as the Norwegian language and culture. The outdoor class spent about 40 nights on the Hardangervidda, Northern Europes largest mountain plateau, in tents, iglos, snow caves, cabins and under the open sky.</p>

    <p>The summer holiday of 2007 was used to cycle through southern Norway to visit my new Norwegian friends, learn more about Norwegian culture, and make lots of day hikes. Having fallen in love with being outdoors in the Norwegian mountains and fjords, I successfully applied for a job as an assistant outdoorlife teacher at the same school. Another year and 40 nights spent in the Hardanger mountains made me decide to pursue a career, or rather lifestyle, within nature-based tourism and guiding. I got even more convinced about these ambitions two years later, when Hardanger Folkeh√∏gskule hired me as a tour leader and outdoorlife teacher, to arrange a trip to Corsica for 13 students, loaded with activities like canyoning, kayaking, cycling and hiking.</p>

        From 2008 until 2014,the summers were spent in the Stavanger region. During the summer season, I worked at the Tourist Information Office in Stavanger, providing tourists from all corners of the world with information about attractions and activities in this diverse region. When Dutch journalists visited the area, I was their press tour guide. Occasionally, I worked for GuideCompaniet, guiding tourists by foot, bus and boat through Stavanger and the region. Especially the Lysefjord and the amazing hikes to Preikestolen and Kjerag drew my attention.</p></center>
